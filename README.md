# Renewable Energy and Public Transportation Data Analysis

This project demonstrates the analysis of two critical datasets for enhancing sustainable development in Abu Dhabi: Renewable Energy Projects and Public Transportation Utilization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pandas Library
- Matplotlib Library

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib


## Datasets

1. **Renewable Energy Projects in Abu Dhabi**
   - Format: CSV
   - Description: Includes project names, types (solar, wind), capacities, locations, operators, and operational status.

2. **Public Transportation Utilization in Abu Dhabi**
   - Format: CSV
   - Description: Provides details on passenger numbers, routes, service frequency, and coverage areas for buses and taxis.

## Analysis

The analysis involves loading the datasets, filtering data for specific energy types or transport modes, and visualizing the data to derive insights.

### Renewable Energy Projects

- **Objective**: Understand the distribution of solar and wind projects.
- **Method**: Filter the dataset by type and visualize the counts.

### Public Transportation Utilization

- **Objective**: Analyze the total passenger usage of buses and taxis.
- **Method**: Sum passenger numbers for each mode and visualize.

## Running the Code

Ensure the CSV files are in the same directory as the script and run the Python code provided in the 'working_example_code' section to see the analysis results.
